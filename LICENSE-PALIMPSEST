# Palimpsest License v0.8

Copyright (c) 2025 FSLint Contributors

## Preamble

This license embodies the principle that software is a **palimpsest** - a manuscript
that can be erased and overwritten while preserving traces of its history. Like
physical palimpsests, software evolves through layers of contribution, each building
upon and transforming what came before.

The Palimpsest License recognizes that software development is:
- **Iterative**: Built through successive refinements
- **Collaborative**: Created by many hands over time
- **Reversible**: Changes can be undone or reconsidered
- **Historical**: Past versions remain accessible

## Grant of Rights

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal
in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights
to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell
copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

## Conditions

### 1. Attribution Through Layers

You must preserve:
- Original copyright notices
- License text
- Attribution to all substantial contributors
- Links to source repository

You may add your own copyright notice alongside existing ones, creating
new layers while preserving old ones.

### 2. Reversibility

When technically feasible:
- Provide version control history (e.g., Git commit log)
- Enable users to access previous versions
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Offer migration paths for major changes

This recognizes that software evolution should be **traceable and reversible**.

### 3. Consent for Derivatives

If you create a derivative work that **substantially transforms** the original:
- Clearly mark your work as derived
- Link to the original source
- Document your changes
- Respect the original's intent where practical

"Substantial transformation" means changing core purpose, architecture, or
design philosophy - not mere bug fixes or feature additions.

### 4. Commercial Use

Commercial use is permitted, but:
- **Attribution required**: Credit original authors
- **No washing**: Don't obscure the palimpsest nature
- **Share improvements**: Contribute bug fixes back (strongly encouraged, not required)

### 5. Patent Peace

If you initiate patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim
or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Software constitutes patent
infringement, your rights under this License shall terminate automatically.

### 6. No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

### 7. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE
USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

## Special Provisions

### Emotional Safety

Recognizing that software development involves human emotion:

- **No obligation to justify**: You may decline contributions without detailed explanation
- **Right to fork**: Dissatisfied users may fork without prejudice
- **Reversible decisions**: Maintainers may change direction
- **Burn-out protection**: Temporary or permanent withdrawal is acceptable

### AI Training

Use of this software for AI training is permitted under these conditions:

- **Attribution**: Credit original authors in model documentation
- **Disclosure**: Disclose use of this software as training data when asked
- **License preservation**: Don't use AI to launder license obligations
- **Ethical use**: Don't train models for malicious purposes

### Sustainability

If this software becomes commercially successful:

- **Consider contributions**: Support original authors (optional but encouraged)
- **Upstream fixes**: Share bug fixes and improvements
- **Community support**: Help answer questions from users
- **Recognition**: Credit the palimpsest of contributors

## License Compatibility

This license is compatible with:
- MIT License
- Apache License 2.0
- BSD licenses
- Mozilla Public License 2.0

You may dual-license or multi-license your derivative work.

## Termination

Your rights under this license terminate automatically if you violate any
condition. You may cure violations within 30 days of discovering them.

## Definitions

- **Software**: The original work and derivatives
- **You**: The individual or legal entity exercising rights
- **Derivative work**: A work based upon the Software
- **Substantial transformation**: Changes to core purpose/architecture
- **Attribution**: Credit given to original authors

## Version

This is **Palimpsest License v0.8** (November 2025).

Future versions may refine these terms. You may use the Software under this
version or any later version.

## Philosophical Foundation

The Palimpsest License recognizes that:

1. **Software is layered**: Like a palimpsest manuscript, each contribution
   adds a new layer while traces of the old remain visible

2. **History matters**: Past decisions and code have value even when superseded

3. **Reversibility is freedom**: The ability to go back empowers experimentation

4. **Attribution is continuous**: Credit flows through all layers, not just the top

5. **Evolution is natural**: Software changes are expected and welcomed

6. **Humans matter**: Emotional and social aspects of development are real

## Why "Palimpsest"?

A palimpsest is a manuscript page from which text has been scraped off so that
it can be reused. However, traces of the original text remain visible beneath
the new text. This metaphor captures software development perfectly:

- We build on foundations laid by others
- Old code is refactored but its influence remains
- History is layered, not erased
- Each contribution is part of a continuum
